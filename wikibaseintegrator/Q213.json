What follows is the example json file which is used by add-articles-by-file.py. 
Q213 represents the item number for the issue item that all these articles will 
be organized into. You will need to rename the file according to the item number
for the issue that you are working on. ChatGPT is helpful in quickly taking a list of
title/author/page range details and formatting them into a file like this. 

Be sure to delete these comments before trying to copy this file. Also, I will try and
fix it later but "author": "Editorial" doesn't function correctly right now, process that
one manually.
