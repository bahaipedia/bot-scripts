What follows is the example json file which is used by import-articles.py.
ChatGPT is helpful in quickly taking a list of title/author/page range details 
and formatting them into a file like this. 

Author takes one or two paramaters, see below. If there is no author in the case
of an editorial, right now that is not supported. I'll try to add it later.
