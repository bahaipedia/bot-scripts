What follows is the example json file which is used by import-articles.py.
ChatGPT is helpful in quickly taking a list of title/author/editor/page range details 
and formatting them into a file like this. 

Author takes one or more paramaters, see below. "instanceof" accepts any input. Some 
common ones are: editorial (Q19), poem (Q44), compilation (Q65), excerpt (Q426), index (Q540)
but they do not need to exist before the script is run. It will ask you if you want to create
the item if it doesn't exist.

Be sure to delete this comment before trying to use this file. Note the lack of a comma in
the last item in the series after "page_range": "256" below.
